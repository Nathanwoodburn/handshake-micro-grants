G'day,  
I'm Nathan Woodburn, a Handshake enthusiast from Australia.  
I have worked on multiple Handshake related projects including
- HNSHosting - A Handshake website hosting service (https://hnshosting)  
Now with a discord bot to provide a easy and free way to host your Handshake website

- HNSProxy - A Handshake proxy service to allow easy resolving of domains (https://hnsproxy.au)
WARNING: This is a hosted service and is not trustless or decentralised

- HSD Batcher - A tool to allow easy transaction batching via HSD API (https://github.com/Nathanwoodburn/HSDBatcherGUI)

- FireWallet - A Handshake wallet for Windows built on C# .net (https://firewallet.au/)

- FireWallet Lite - A simple wallet to allow very basic transactions (https://git.woodburn.au/nathanwoodburn/FireWalletLite)  
Made for allowing you to send some domains for a friend to use without them needing to understand the Handshake ecosystem fully. Plus it is easy to brand for your own redistribution.

- HNS Scripts - A collection of scripts to allow easy installation and setup of Handshake websites, mirror and redirects. Also includes scripts to deploy a Handshake registry based on [Varo](https://varo.domains) https://github.com/Nathanwoodburn/HNS-server/

- HNSCall - A voice chat on a Handshake domain (https://hnscall)


A few projects I would like to do:
- Adding Wordpress hosting to HNSHosting (only problem is the system resources so this might be a paid feature) ([already created most of the script](https://github.com/Nathanwoodburn/HNS-server/blob/main/wp.sh))    
This would allow most quality websites to be hosted on Handshake domains.
More info on this can be found [here](Wordpress_Hosting.md)

- Email hosting (***for a later date***)  
This is a bigger project which I am planning to work on over the new year break.  
This would be a paid service, but the installation scripts will be available for free to allow anyone to host their own email server.  
This would increase the value of Handshake domains as they would be able to be used for email addresses without the need for hours or days of setup.



Feel free to contact me on Discord (Nathan.Woodburn/ on any Handshake related server) or via email (handshake@nathan.woodburn.au).
